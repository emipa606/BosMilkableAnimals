Bison and Llama
	
--- Original Description ---
Makes deer, gazelles, ibexes, and alpacas milkable.

Gives more reason to tame these animals or buy them from traders when on extreme biomes. Milk, an important part of every colonists diet.

Some biomes don't spawn milkable animals. Temperate woodlands and arid shrublands for example, are teeming with deer, goats, and gazelles yet they're only good for meat and leather. 
Now when these animals self-tame or a tamed herd arrives you have a reason to keep them, instead of immediately slaughtering them. Great for tribals too.

This mod now uses the new PatchOperations, guranteeing maximum compatibility with other mods. I recommend placing this mod at the bottom of your mod load order.
